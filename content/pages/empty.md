      Welcome to my website! I’m Alex Mardle, a 13-year-old magician performing
      across the UK.


      By using this website or contacting me, you agree to the following simple
      terms:


      1.  **Bookings** — All shows and events are arranged directly through me.
      Prices and details will be confirmed in writing before a booking is final.


      2.  **Cancellations** — If you need to cancel or change a booking, please
      let me know as soon as possible. I’ll always do my best to rearrange or
      refund fairly.


      3.  **Performance Details** — Each event is unique, and performance length
      or tricks may vary slightly based on audience, venue, and timing.


      4.  **Liability** — I always perform safely and professionally, but I
      can’t accept responsibility for things outside my control (like venue
      issues or technical problems).


      5.  **Website Content** — All text, photos, and videos on this site belong
      to me. Please don’t copy or reuse them without permission.


      If you have any questions, feel free to get in touch with
      contact\@alexmardle.com or through the contact form — I’ll be happy to
      help.
